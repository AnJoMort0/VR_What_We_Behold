# VR What We Behold

**Fan quasi-VR-port of _We Become What We Behold_**  
_Prototype Phase_

An experimental virtual-reality adaptation of Nicky Case’s satirical news-cycle game. In headset or desktop mode, you aim a retro camera overlay at wandering “peeps,” snap a photo, and watch how your freeze-frame alters the narrative.
