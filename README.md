# VR What We Behold

Test the latest prototype I tested in VR: https://anjomorto.itch.io/vrwwb-t. Password: VR-access
_Dev Mode (skip cooldowns -may cause sync bugs-, and see Peep's ID's)_: "d" on keyboard, "up arrow/up d-pad" on remote


**Fan quasi-VR-port of _We Become What We Behold_**  

_Prototype Phase_

An experimental virtual-reality adaptation of Nicky Case’s satirical news-cycle game. In headset or desktop mode, you aim a retro camera overlay at wandering “peeps,” snap a photo, and watch how your freeze-frame alters their behaviour.
